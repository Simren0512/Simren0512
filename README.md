About Me 
Hi I'm Simrenpreet Kaur from School Of Computer Sciences USM. 

My Final Year Project 
Student Personal Assistance is a platform that can facilitate the scheduling of students wherever and whenever. It has My Study Life, Social Network and Fitness Track and Healthy Eating Subsystems.

MY FYP Subsystem 
Student Personal Assistance (Subsystem 2: Social Network) 
Social Network enables students to create their profile online and chat with each other. It aims to improve the communication and collaboration skills with their college students. It allows instructors and students to work together to share, discuss and deeply engage with learning. Slack channels replace the use of email communication throughout courses. More features are to be added.
